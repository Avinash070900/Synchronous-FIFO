Implementation of a Synchronous FIFO(First In First Out) using Verilog (Self Project)

∗ Design involves handling the Read and Write operations of data using the same clock frequency keeping in track of
Full and Empty condition to prevent overflow and underflow.
∗ The implementation was verified through testbenches to ensure accurate and efficient data handling within digital
systems.
∗ Tool Used- EDA Playground
